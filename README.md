The main Arduino code for my project is located at the folder DroneBT_v1.0.ino. The project report is the file called "Drone CS193 Report." 
The schematic of the drone is called droneBT_schematic. The folder called "Drone_app" contains files of my app. The apk file is also there.
The other two folder contains pictures of my first and second versions of my drones.
